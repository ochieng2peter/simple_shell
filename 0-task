/*
 * simple_shell.c
 *
 * A simple UNIX command line interpreter that mimics basic functionalities of
 * a shell. It displays a prompt, waits for the user to enter a command,
 * executes the command, and displays the prompt again until the end of file
 * (Ctrl+D) is detected.
 *
 * Usage: simple_shell
 *
 * This shell implementation supports single-word command lines, does not use
 * the PATH environment variable, does not implement built-in commands or
 * handle special characters, and does not
 * support command arguments or cursor movement.
 *
 * Compilation: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
